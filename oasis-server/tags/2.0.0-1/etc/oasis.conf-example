#
#   oasis.conf 
#
# Initial configuration file for OASIS
# Includes some basic variables -in section [OASIS]-
# and the path to the rest of configuration files
# in the other sections
#
# The path to this config file is setup in two different places:
#       -- within /usr/bin/oasis for the user
#       -- /etc/sysconfig/oasis.sysconfig  for the daemon
# This config file may be split in the future into two different files,
# so it is a good thing to have it setup separately by these two clients.

# Examples for the other configuration files, pointed by the variables in here,
# can be found in /usr/share/doc/oasis-X.Y.Z
#
# WARNING: 
#
#   The name of the only section in this config file *must* be [OASIS].
#   Do not change it.
