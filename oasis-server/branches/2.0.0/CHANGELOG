Branch 2.0.0 created on August 21st 2013.
It is intended, in principle, to host just the condor USER_JOB_WRAPPER, 
as first step to move from OASIS 1 to OASIS 2.x is 
just to add a gatekeeper and a WN with a condor startd.
It is based on 1.0.1, which is a variation of tarball content provided by Scott.
