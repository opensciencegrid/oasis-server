Branch 2.0.3
(created on November 2013, branch 2.0.3 is similar to branch 2.0.2 except uses a daemon instead of a setuid binary)


* now the oasis_job_wrapper only calls once to /usr/bin/oasis. And no input options, only the user payload stuffs
  All calls to methods from bin/oasis done in a single thread.

* change name: condor_oasis_wrapper ->  oasis_job_wrapper

* added preinstall() and postinstall() methods to oasispackage/oasis.py

* added 'preinstall' and 'postinstall' blocks to bin/oasis

* add two extra calls to /usr/bin/oasis: for preinstall and postinstall

* deleted src/ directory, which contains in 2.0.2 the C code for the setuid binary.
  delete line in condor wrapper calling the setuid binary



Branch 2.0.2 
(created on September 19th 2013)

* created directory  distributionplugins/ and first draft for cvmfs.py plugin

* created first draft for generic oasis.conf python-style config file

* created python binary oasis, to be deployed at /usr/bin/oasis

* new variables added to oasis_setup.sh, which now also can include the name of the VO in the paths.

* name changed oasis_setup.sh -> setup.sh



Branch 2.0.1

* added a second logging Handler, so message to stdout are INFO level and message to /var/log/oasis/oasis.log are DEBUG level.

* scratch area looks like  

       /<path>/ouser.<vo>/src/ 
       /<path>/ouser.<vo>/oasis/

  where src/ is the directory pointed by OSG_APP, and oasis is where to place the lock files.

* reverse rsync when probes are not passed OK

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branch 2.0.0 created on August 21st 2013.
It is intended, in principle, to host just the condor USER_JOB_WRAPPER, 
as first step to move from OASIS 1 to OASIS 2.x is 
just to add a gatekeeper and a WN with a condor startd.
It is based on 1.0.1, which is a variation of tarball content provided by Scott.

* USER_JOB_WRAPPER makes use of OASIS_USER_WORKING_DIRECTORY, and gets the VO from the X509 proxy

* cron files handled by setup.py 

* add a check in condor_oasis_wrapper to see if osg-oasis-update is in the PATH

* adding the misc/ scripts rpm-pre, rpm-post, and rpm-preun

* adding distutils files (setup.py, setup.cfg, and MANIFEST) and LICENSE

* adding timing report to libexec/condor_oasis_wrapper

* adding function pre_run to condor_oasis_wrapper to setup $OSG_APP

* etc/condor_oasis.conf added

* libexec/condor_oasis_wrapper.sh added
