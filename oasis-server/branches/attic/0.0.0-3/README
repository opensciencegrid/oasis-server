Architecture in this branch is as follows:

    --  The daemon can launch an arbitrary number 
        of parallel threads, one per each section
        if the tasks.conf configuration file.

    --  Each one of these threads executes
        a given plugin. The plugin name comes from 
        the tasks.conf configuration file. 

    --  Therefore three is no any predetermined plugin
        or task to be done.
