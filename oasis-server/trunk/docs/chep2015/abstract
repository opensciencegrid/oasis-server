The Open Science Grid service for softare distribution (OASIS) 
has been already in production for longer than one year. 
However, to ensure a higher level of quality service, some 
improvements have been implemented or will be in the future. 

This paper describes the different aspects of the project OASIS, 
depending on the point of view:
as a product that can be deployed at any place, 
as a service provided centrally by Open Science Grid, 
and as a network of federated partners in a many-to-many servers-to-clients architecture.

An evaluation of the central service performanc is presented.
A description of the product components is presented.
A description of the mechanism to allow partern to join the network is presented.
