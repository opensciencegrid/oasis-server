The Open Science Grid service for softare distribution (OASIS) 
has been already in production for longer than one year. 
However, to ensure a higher level of quality service, some 
improvements have been implemented or will be in the future. 

This paper describes the different aspects of the project OASIS, 
depending on the point of view:
as a product that can be deployed at any place, 
as a service provided centrally by Open Science Grid, 
and as a network of federated partners in a many-to-many servers-to-clients architecture.

In order to evaluate properly the performance of the central service, 
a monitor is (will) be setup collecting run time data for auditing and troubleshooting. 
(examples of graphs with those data are shown in this paper)

To facilitate the usage as well administration of the product, 
a suite user and admintrator toolbox has been (is being) deployed. 

The mechanism to allow parterns to join the network is described.
The infrastructure allows other servers to distribute their content
without the need to distribute a new set of keys to the clients.
