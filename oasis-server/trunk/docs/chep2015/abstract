###         ABSTRACT FOR CHEP 2013
###
###   The Open Science Grid encourages the concept of software portability:
###   a user's scientific application should be able to run at as many sites as
###   possible.
###   It is necessary to provide a mechanism for OSG Virtual Organizations to install software at sites.
###   Since its initial release, the OSG Compute Element has provided an application
###   software installation directory to Virtual Organizations, where they can create
###   their own sub-directory, install software into that sub-directory, and have the
###   directory shared on the worker nodes at that site.
###   
###   The current model has shortcomings with regard to permissions,
###   policies, versioning, and the lack of a unified, collective procedure or toolset for deploying software across all sites.
###   Therefore, a new mechanism for data and software distributing is desirable.
###   
###   The architecture for the OSG Application Software Installation Service (OASIS) is a server-client model:
###   the software and data are installed only once in a single place,
###   and are automatically distributed to all client sites simultaneously.
###   
###   Central file distribution offers other advantages,
###   including server-side authentication and authorization, activity records, quota management,
###   data validation and inspection, and well-defined versioning and deletion policies.
###   
###   The architecture, as well as a complete analysis of the current implementation, will be described in this paper.
