The Open Science Grid Application Software Installation Service (OASIS)
has been already in production for more than one year. However, to ensure a higher level of quality service, some improvements have been completed or are in progress.

This paper describes the different aspects of the OASIS project: as a product that can be deployed by OSG virtual organizations, or others (OASIS as a Product, or OP), as a service provided centrally by Open Science Grid (OASIS as a Service, or OS), and as a network of federated partners in a many-to-many servers-to-clients architecture (OASIS as a network, or ON).



[Should we include here some paragraph on internals, or that is too much detail?]
[From the section OASIS architecture in the OasisDeployment twiki page:]
 OASIS 2 is built around two key concepts:
    Repositories. A Repository is a single content management unit. That means, the whole amount of content to be distributed together. 
    Projects. A Project is a single administrative management unit. In other words, refers to the data being managed by a given unique UNIX ID. 
A Project must belong to a Repository, and only one. A Repository can have one or more Projects.
A Repository is composed by the source directory, the destination directory, and the particular underlying technology to distribute content. Currently the only technology being used by OASIS is CVMFS.
A Project is composed by the source directory (relative to the source directory of the repository it belongs to) and the destination directory (relative to the destination directory of the repository it belongs to).
Each Project is associated to one, and only one, UNIX ID. This UNIX ID is the username of the users logged into the OASIS login host, and also the identity under which the OASIS daemon runs some tasks. 



An evaluation of the current utilization of OASIS as a Service is presented. In order to evaluate properly the performance of the central service, a monitor collects runtime data for auditing and troubleshooting. Examples of graphs with those data are shown.

[For example, those requested already by Miron. Will they be made using the python API?]

To facilitate the usage and administration of OASIS as a Product,
a suite of user and administrator tools have been developed. They are described.

The mechanism to allow partners to join the OASIS as a Network is described. The infrastructure allows other servers to distribute their content without the need to distribute a new set of keys to the clients.
The security aspects of this model is described. Those include both the proper central management of cryptographic keys, and the real time monitoring of the remote servers content being accepted into the network, as well as a mechanism to ban that content in case of problems.

Finally, proposals for future plans are described.

The Open Science Grid Application Software Installation Service (OASIS) 
provides an application-install service for OSG virtual organizations built on top of the CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS).  
This paper provides an overview and progress report of this service, 
which has been in production for over a year.  
OASIS can either be used directly as a service run by OSG Operations or as a standalone software product.  
In either use case, the VOâ€™s files feed into a network of Stratum-1 servers, along with other partners within the federation.  
The OASIS network has the flexibility of allowing pure CVMFS repositories, 
the OSG-run central OASIS repository, or VO-run OASIS repositories.  
Depending on their needs, VOs can integrate into OASIS at several different points, leading to a complex trust model than standard CVMFS.

This paper describes how the usage and implementation of OASIS has evolved in the last 18 months, along with operational successes and issues. 
Topics such as monitoring CVMFS, handling of cryptographic keys, 
and how we both technical & organizationally establish trust relationships are covered.  
Finally, a roadmap for the future is presented.
