The Open Science Grid Application Software Installation Service (OASIS)
has been already in production for more than one year. However, to ensure a higher level of quality service, some improvements have been completed or are in progress.

This paper describes the different aspects of the OASIS project: as a product that can be deployed by OSG virtual organizations, or others (OASIS as a Product, or OP), as a service provided centrally by Open Science Grid (OASIS as a Service, or OS), and as a network of federated partners in a many-to-many servers-to-clients architecture (OASIS as a network, or ON).

An evaluation of the current utilization of OASIS as a Service is presented. In order to evaluate properly the performance of the central service, a monitor collects runtime data for auditing and troubleshooting. Examples of graphs with those data are shown.

[For example, those requested already by Miron. Will they be made using the python API?]

To facilitate the usage and administration of OASIS as a Product,
a suite of user and administrator tools have been developed. They are described.

The mechanism to allow parters to join the OASIS as a Network is described. The infrastructure allows other servers to distribute their content without the need to distribute a new set of keys to the clients.
The security aspects of this model is described. Those include both the proper central management of cryptographic keys, and the real time monitoring of the remote servers content being accepted into the network, as well as a mechanism to ban that content in case of problems.

Finally, proposals for future plans are described.
