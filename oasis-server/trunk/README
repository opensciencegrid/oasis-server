INTRO

OASIS is a high level end-to-end software to manage grid-based file distribution.


INSTALLATION

To install using RPMs (i.e. installing as root) read INSTALL-ROOT.
Once installed, there are two components:

    -- the client:
       the user client is placed in /usr/bin/oasis
       It can be called directly from the command line,
       or it is automatically called by the condor wrapper
       in case of jobs submitted via a gatekeeper.

    -- the daemon:
       The service  /etc/init.d/oasis needs to be started
       in order to allow OASIS to complete the distribution process:
       passing the sanity checks -or probes- on the new user content,
       transferring the new content to final distribution tree,
       and triggering the file distribution.
       Configuration for the daemon is in /etc/sysconfig/oasis.sysconfig
