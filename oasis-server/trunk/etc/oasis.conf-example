#
#   oasis.conf 
#
# Initial configuration file for OASIS
# Includes some basic variables -in section [OASIS]-
# and the path to the rest of configuration files
# in the other sections
#
# The path to this config file is setup in two different places:
#       -- within /usr/bin/oasis for the user
#       -- /etc/sysconfig/oasis.sysconfig  for the daemon
# This config file may be split in the future into two different files,
# so it is a good thing to have it setup separately by these two clients.

# time.sleep = it is the time between cycles for the daemon,
#              waiting to see if all threads, one per Project, 
#              need to be shutdown
