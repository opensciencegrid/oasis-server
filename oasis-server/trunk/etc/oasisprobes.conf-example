# the section name is just an uniq string,

# This allows to have several probes

# probe = is the actual name of probe.
#        The probe code will be invoked by a wrapper whose name is
#
#               /usr/bin/oasis-runprobe-<probe>
#
#        where <probe> is the value of this variable 'probe'
#        In case of a project-specific probe, therefore, 
#        it can be something like  <project>-<probe>, which
#        will be invoked by wrapper
#
#               /usr/bin/oasis-runprobe-<project>-<probe>
#
# options = list of input options to be passed raw to the probe
#
# enabled = True|False variable.
# The probe is only executed is enabled = True
#
# level = warning|abort
#       if warning, just logs a WARNING message, but return 0 (OK)
#       if abort, logs a CRITICAL message and return 1 (probe failed)
